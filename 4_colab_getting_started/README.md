# SecureNPrivateAIScholarshipCodes
This repository contains codes undertaken during secure and private AI scholarship Udacity's course.
* **GettingStartedWithColab** folder contains my notes on working with Colab enviornment for begineers. In **edgeDetection.ipynb** project, I have implemented a canny edge detector with an aim to familizarise with accessing your drive and working on simple opencv-numpy project in Colab enviornment. Also,in	**MNISTwithPytorchAndColab.ipynb** code I have implemented a MNIST dataset based number classifer within Colab using Pytorch.

* **DeepLearningwithPyTorch** folder contains **fashionMnist.ipynb**, **transferLearningDatasetGit.ipynb** and **transferLearningKaggle.ipynb** codes. **fashionMnist.ipynb** code is implemented to familiarize with how to store checkpoints during training, test the classifer on interim checkpoint and restart training from the last stored checkpoint. The transfer learning codes show the implemention of cat vs dog classifier on densenet121 architecture. **transferLearningDatasetGit.ipynb** code acesses cat-dog dataset from github and **transferLearningKaggle.ipynb** code downloads the dataset from kaggle in Colab enviornment.
